      "question": "What is a Hackathon?",
      "answer":
        "A hackathon is a weekend-long event where you can build out your ideas, network, and show off your skills. At CruzHacks, you can form teams, discover an idea, build it, and show it off at the end. Hundreds of students, sponsors, mentors, and judges gather together to push the limits of what you can build, only limited by your imagination. CruzHacks will conduct workshops for you to learn new skills and network with folks, so don’t worry if this is your first time attending a hackathon!"
